## MENTI (Winner for Best Use of Open Source @ Serenity Hacks)

## What is Menti
Menti is a habit tracker app meant to encourage self-care and well-being. This is a desktop JavaFX application. Our app is a multifunctional app with features of habit tracking, sleep tracking, and meditation features.
The main highlight of our application is that the habits the user inputs into their list can receive words of encouragement as well as feedback and suggestions from OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo language model.

## Why use Menti

The app can be seen as a habitual tracker as it allows them to use the to-do list to list their activities that they have to do everyday, and once they check each one off, it gives them a sense of satsifaction. It allows them to also have a general understanding of their well being, such as the amount of hours of sleep they are getting. Finally, it can be used as a meditation space for them to lower their cortosol levels.
